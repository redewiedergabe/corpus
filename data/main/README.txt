This folder contains the main release of the core corpus REDEWIEDERGABE.
It consists of text samples (about 500 tokens for fictional, and 200-500 tokens for non-fictional), is balanced over decades and for fictional/non-fictional and is annotated with a consensus annotation based on two independent primary annotations.

Folder "tsv" contains the data in column-based plain text format (encoding: UTF-8).
Folder "xmi" contains the data in XMI format, as used by the annotation framework DKPro (https://dkpro.github.io/). NOTE: We provide XMI files as a convenience for DKPro users, but offer no further support for this format.
Folder "xml" contains the data in TEI compliant XML format.

For more detailed information please consult the documentation.
