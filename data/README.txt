This folder contains all the annotated material provided by project REDEWIEDERGABE. All material comes from fictional and non-fictional German texts published between 1840 and 1919.

Folder "main" contains the main release of the core corpus REDEWIEDERGABE. It consists of text samples (about 500 tokens for fictional, and 200-500 tokens for non-fictional), is balanced over decades and for fictional/non-fictional and is annotated with a consensus annotation based on two independent primary annotations.
Folder "additional" contains additional annotated material created by project REDEWIEDERGABE. It consists of text samples as well as full texts and generally uses the same annotation system as the core corpus, though there are some idiosyncrasis and less quality control.
