This folder contains complete fictional and non-fictional texts annotated with only indirect STWR.

This subcorpus was created to generate training data for the automatic recognizers developed by project REDEWIEDERGABE. The annotation system is strongly reduced, only specifying the type indirect (without medium or attributes). Frame, intExpr and speaker are not annotated.
To create this corpus, the texts were tagged by a beta version of the automatic indirect recognizer. The annotation was then corrected by humans who checked the whole texts, so false negatives were corrected as well. Annotation quality should therefore be comparable to the single-annotated files (data/additional/single_annotated).

Folder "tsv" contains the data in column-based plain text format (encoding: UTF-8). (NOTE: The information is strongly reduced, only columns "tok" and "cat" are provided.)
