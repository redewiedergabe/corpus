This folder contains complete fictional texts annotated with only free indirect STWR.

This subcorpus was created to generate training data for the automatic recognizers developed by project REDEWIEDERGABE. The annotation system is strongly reduced, only specifying the type free indirect (without medium or attributes). Frame, intExpr and speaker are not annotated.
The annotations were generated semi-automatically: The texts were tagged by a beta version of the automatic free indirect recognizer. The annotations and their immediate environment were then checked by humans, who, if necessary, deleted, corrected or extended the annotations.

NOTE: As instances of free indirect that were not detected by the automatic recognizer were never presented to the humans, this corpus most likely contains false negatives (unlabled free indirect instances)!

Folder "tsv" contains the data in column-based plain text format (encoding: UTF-8).
Folder "xmi" contains the data in XMI-format, as used by the annotation framework DKPro (https://dkpro.github.io/). NOTE: We provide XMI files as a convenience for DKPro users, but offer no further support for this format.
Folder "xml" contains the data in TEI-compliant XML format.
