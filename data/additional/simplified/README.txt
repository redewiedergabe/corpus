This folder contains additional complete texts annotated with only indirect or free indirect STWR with a simplified annotation system.
These annotations were created semi-automatically in order to generate training data for the automatic recognizers developed by project REDEWIEDERGABE. The annotation system is strongly reduced, only specifying the type indirect or free indirect (without medium and attributes). Frame, intExpr and speaker are not annotated.
The metadata information for these files is also more sparse than the metadata for the core corpus (data/main) and the single-annotated files in additional/single_annotated.

The folder "free_indirect" contains texts annotated with only free indirect STWR.
The folder "indirect" contains texts annotated with only indirect STWR.
