This folder contains additional material (complete texts and text samples) annotated with the full annotation system but only by single annotators.
The collection is roughly balanced for fictional vs. non-fictional as well as for decades.
The metadata information is somewhat more sparse than the core corpus metadata, but provides an additional slot "annotator". The pseudonyms used there are the same as in the primary annotation corpus (data/additional/primary). 

Folder "full_fict" contains complete fictional texts. (NOTE: The annotation guidelines regarding the speaker annotation have been adjusted for some of these texts.)
Folder "full_nonfict" contains complete non-fictional texts.
Folder "samples" contains fictional and non-fictional text samples (about 500 tokens for fictional, and 200-500 tokens for non-fictional)

For more detailed information please consult the documentation.
