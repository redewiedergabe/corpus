This folder contains complete fictional texts, annotated by single annotators.

NOTE: The annotation guidelines regarding the speaker annotation have been adjusted for some of the texts in the following way: For the forms direct and indirect only character names (or content words unambiguously referring to a specific character) were annotated as speaker, even if there were pronouns or general phrases (like “the man”) closer to the corresponding STWR instance. This adjustment makes it easier to assign the direct and indirect STWR to a character, thus allowing for evaluations of the character’s representation in the text.
The adjustment affected only the following texts:
rwz_full_digbib_1136
rwz_full_digbib_1199
rwz_full_digbib_3153
rwz_full_digbib_5000
rwz_full_digbib_5001
rwz_full_digbib_5002

Folder "tsv" contains the data in column-based plain text format (encoding: UTF-8).
Folder "xmi" contains the data in XMI-format, as used by the annotation framework DKPro (https://dkpro.github.io/). NOTE: We provide XMI files as a convenience for DKPro users, but offer no further support for this format.
Folder "xml" contains the data in TEI-compliant XML format.
