This folder contains complete fictional texts (annotated by single annotators) in XMI format, as used by the annotation framework DKPro (https://dkpro.github.io/).
Each file contains one text, its metadata and the annotations of project REDEWIEDERGABE.

Folder "resources" contains the type systems needed to process the XMI files.

NOTE: We provide XMI files as a convenience for DKPro users, but offer no further support for this format.

For more detailed information please consult the documentation.
