This folder contains the type systems needed to process the XMI files.

"rwTypesystem.xml" is the minimal type system needed to work with the XMI files in DKPro.
"rwTypesystem_stwrview.xml" contains some additional definitions needed to properly display the texts in the ATHEN annotation tool (https://gitlab2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/kallimachos/Athen) with its STWR view.

For more detailed information please consult the documentation.
