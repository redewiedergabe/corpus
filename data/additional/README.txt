This folder contains additional annotated material created by project REDEWIEDERGABE. All material comes from fictional and non-fictional German texts published between 1840 and 1919. The data consists of text samples as well as complete texts and generally uses the same annotation system as the core corpus, though there are some idiosyncrasis and less quality control.

Folder "primary" contains a collection of all individual annotations of the text samples of core corpus REDEWIEDERGABE (data/main) by different annotators. This material can be used for studying annotator agreement.
Folder "simplified" contains additional complete texts annotated with only indirect or free indirect STWR with a simplified annotation system and by single annotators.
Folder "single_annotated" contains additional material (complete texts and text samples) annotated with the full annotation system but only by single annotators.
