This folder contains all core corpus samples annotated by the human annotator with the pseudonym "pluto". The file names correspond to the names of the files of the core corpus (data/main). The annotation can be contrasted with the consensus annotation (/data/additional/primary/consensus) or with competing annotations in other planet folders. To find competing annotations for individual files, consult the table in data/additional/primary/annotators_per_file.tsv.

Folder "tsv" contains the data in column-based plain text format (encoding: UTF-8).
Folder "xmi" contains the data in XMI format, as used by the annotation framework DKPro (https://dkpro.github.io/). NOTE: We provide XMI files as a convenience for DKPro users, but offer no further support for this format.
Folder "xml" contains the data in TEI compliant XML format.

For more detailed information please consult the documentation.
