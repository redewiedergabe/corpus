This folder contains the same text samples and consensus annotations as the core corpus (data/main) column-based plain text format (encoding: UTF-8). In contrast to the core corpus, the text samples are tokenized with OpenNLP so that they can be aligned with the annotations in the planet folders.
Each file contains the text of one sample and the annotations of project REDEWIEDERGABE.

"metadata.tsv" contains the metadata information.

For more detailed information please consult the documentation.
