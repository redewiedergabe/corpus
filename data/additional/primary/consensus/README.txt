This folder contains the same text samples and consensus annotation as the core corpus (data/main). In contrast to the core corpus, the text samples are tokenized with OpenNLP so that they can be aligned with the annotations in the planet folders.

Folder "tsv" contains the data in column-based plain text format (encoding: UTF-8).

For more detailed information please consult the documentation.
