This folder contains the same text samples and consensus annotation as the core corpus (data/main). In contrast to the core corpus, the text samples are tokenized with OpenNLP so that they can be aligned with the annotations in the planet folders.
NOTE: The xmi files of the main corpus (data/main/xmi) contain OpenNLP Tokens as well (Annotation "Token"), so they can also be used for alignment.

Folder "tsv" contains the data in column-based plain text format (encoding: UTF-8).

For more detailed information please consult the documentation.
