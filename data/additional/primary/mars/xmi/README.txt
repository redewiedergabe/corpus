This folder contains all core corpus samples annotated by the human annotator with the pseudonym "mars" in XMI-format, as used by the annotation framework DKPro (https://dkpro.github.io/).
Each file contains the text of one sample, its metadata and the annotations of project REDEWIEDERGABE.

The type systems needed to process the XMI files can be found in data/additional/primary/resources_xmi.

NOTE: We provide XMI files as a convenience for DKPro users, but offer no further support for this format.

For more detailed information please consult the documentation.
