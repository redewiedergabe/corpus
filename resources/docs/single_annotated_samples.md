# Single-annotated samples

Folder: [data/additional/single_annotated/samples](../../data/additional/single_annotated/samples)

This is a collection of fictional and non-fictional samples that follow the same guidelines as the samples of the main corpus. The only difference is that the annotation was performed by only one annotator with no additional quality control. 

The collection is roughly balanced for fictional vs. non-fictional as well as for decades.
