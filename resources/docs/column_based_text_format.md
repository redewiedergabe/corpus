# Column based text format 

# General remarks

Folder: subfolders called `tsv`

Each tsv-folder contains two files (tsv and Excel format) with a name starting with 'metadata' that contain corpus metadata.

The corpus consists of UTF-8 coded files with the file ending "tsv" (tab-separated values). Each file contains a sample in a column-based format. The columns are separated by tab stops and each line corresponds to one token of the sample. Tokenization was performed with [CAB](https://kaskade.dwds.de/demo/cab/file) available via [Deutsches Textarchiv](http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de) for all corpora except the [primary annotations corpus](primary-annotations_main-corpus.md).

In addition to the annotations added by project Redewiedergabe, the files also contain morphosyntactic annotations produced by automatic tools that were not developed by project Redewiedergabe.

For a more detailed explanation of the annotation structure see [Annotation structure](annotation_structure.md).

# Structure of the main STWR annotation
The STWR annotation can have many attributes and can be nested. Because of this, the column **stwr** contains complex values.

* The character `|` (vertical line) is used as separator, if a token has several annotations of different levels (nested STWR). The first annotation can be interpreted as level=1, the second annotation as level=2 etc. (Maximum nesting depth is 5)
* The character `.` (dot) is used to separate the attributes of a single STWR annotation. The following order is used: **Type**, **Medium**, **ID**, Nonfact, Border, Prag, Metaph. The three bold attributes are obligatory, the other four may be missing, if the corresponding attributes are not relevant.
* The attribute border is further specified by a value after the character `=` (equals sign) (e.g. border=state)
* Alternative values are separated by the character `_` (low dash). This can happen for the attributes **Type** (e.g. indirect_freeIndirect) and **Medium** (e.g. speech_thought).

Example:

`direct.speech_writing.3|reported.thought.6.nonfact.border=state`

This token has two overlapping annotations:
* At level 1: direct STWR with ID=3, medium is ambiguous between speech and writing
* At level 2: reported thought with ID=6 and attributes "nonfact" and "border" with the value "state".

# Structure of the annotations frame, speaker and intexpr
These annotations each consist of a name (frame, speaker, intexpr), the character `.` (dot), and the corresponding ID.

Speaker can have multiple IDs, which are separated by the character `_` (low dash).

Example:

`speaker.12_19`

This token is annotated as speaker with two IDs: 12 and 19 (i.e. this speaker is associated with the STWR annotation with ID=12 as well as the STWR annotation with ID=19).
