# First annotations of the main corpus

This is a collection of the primary annotations of the main corpus. Remember: Each sample of the main corpus was annotated independently by two different people. Then, a third person created the final annotation on this basis of which the main corpus finally consists. At this point, the first annotations are made available, from which it is possible to see where the final annotator had work and with which numerous evaluations of the interannotator agreement are possible.
