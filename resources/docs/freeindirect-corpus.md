# Free indirect corpus

folder: [/data/additional/simplified/free_indirect](/data/additional/simplified/free_indirect)

This subcorpus was created to generate training data for our recognizers specifically for **free indirect STWR**. The annotation system is strongly reduced, *only* specifying the type free indirect (without medium and attributes). Frame, intExpr and speaker are not annotated.

The annotations were generated semi-automatically: The texts were  tagged by one of our automatic free indirect recognizers. The annotations and their immediate environment were then checked by humans, who, if necessary, deleted, corrected or extended the annotations. 

**NOTE:** As instances of free indirect that were not detected by the automatic recognizer were never presented to the humans, this data most likely contains **false negatives** (unlabeled free indirect instances)!

## Statistics

This corpus consists of **142 files**, containing **2,647,924 tokens** with	**2,136 instances** of free indirect STWR.


A list of all texts including author, title and year of publication can be found [here](/data/additional/simplified/free_indirect/tsv/metadata_fi.tsv).
