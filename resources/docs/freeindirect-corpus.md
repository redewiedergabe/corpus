# Free indirect corpus

The following statistics are for the additional free indirect-corpus. This subcorpus was created to generate training data especially for free indirect representation. Therefore, only free indirect representation is annotated. No other types of representation are annotated, neither are frame, speaker or intexpr.

To prepare the documents, we used our automatic recognizer to annotate the texts. We then excluded texts with only few annotations. Afterwards, we looked at the automatically generated annotations and their immediate environment and, if necessary, deleted, corrected or extended the annotations. As a result, instances of free indirect are sometimes not found because the recognizer did not label them. We can therefore only guarantee that the existing annotations are wanted by us; however, we cannot exclude that or it is even likely to find further instances of free indirect in the texts.

The corpus is still work in progess; detailled statistical data will follow soon.
