## Differences between the main corpus and the beta release

The [beta version](../../data/beta-release) of the core corpus was first released in February 2019. In November 2019, the [final core corpus](../../data/main) was released.

We keep the beta version for anyone who already started working with this data.

Note the following differences between the beta release and the final release:
* The final release contains more data (220 additional samples)
* The final release contains richer metadata, specifically: orig_filename, narrative, dialect, perspective, quotes
* Some filenames changed, specifially all files ending in *_short* in the main release end in *1* in the beta_release
* There are some minor differences in annotations and metadata values between the two versions
