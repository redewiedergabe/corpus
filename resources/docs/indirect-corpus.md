# Indirect corpus

The following statistics are for the additional indirect-corpus. This subcorpus was created to generate training data especially for indirect representation. Therefore, only indirect representation is annotated, without specifying the media. Although it is fundamental for indirect representation, even the frame is not annotated nor are any other types of representation.
