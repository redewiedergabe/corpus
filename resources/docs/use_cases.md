- test and training data depending on perspective, on fictionality, on time (see [metadata](metadata.md) for further use cases)
- use of the automatic recognizer to annotate other data, for genre studies, comparison of authors etc.


**Linguistics:**
- corpus studies to linguistic pecularities of speech, thought and writing representation, for example introductional expressions, independent subjunctive clauses etc.
- linguistic studies depending on perspective, fictionaliy, time (see [metadata](metadata.md) for further use cases)


**Literary studies:**
- frequency and form of representation in narrative texts in relation to characterisation of characters
- arising and development of different forms of representation over time
- studies depending on perspective, fictionaliy, time (see [metadata](metadata.md) for further use cases)
- studies on genre, single authors etc.

There are differnent processing options using the corpora:
